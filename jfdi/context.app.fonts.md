# Context for app/fonts/GeistMonoVF.woff and GeistVF.woff

## Purpose
These files are web font files used to provide custom typography for the JFDI application. They are part of the Geist font family, which includes both a monospace (GeistMono) and a variable (Geist) font.

## Type
Web Open Font Format (WOFF) files

## Files
1. GeistMonoVF.woff: Geist Mono Variable Font
2. GeistVF.woff: Geist Variable Font

## Usage
- These fonts are likely used throughout the application to maintain consistent and branded typography
- The variable font format (VF) allows for a single font file to contain multiple weights and styles, reducing the overall file size and improving performance

## Implementation
- These fonts are typically imported and used in the application's global styles or in the main layout component
- They may be used with Next.js' built-in font optimization features for improved performance

## Notes
- Geist is a modern, clean sans-serif typeface suitable for both display and body text
- GeistMono is its monospace counterpart, likely used for code snippets or areas requiring fixed-width text
- The use of variable fonts indicates a focus on performance and flexibility in typography

## Potential Improvements
- Ensure that fallback fonts are specified in case the custom fonts fail to load
- Consider providing alternate formats (like woff2) for broader browser support and better compression
- Implement font subsetting if the entire character set is not needed, to further reduce file size
