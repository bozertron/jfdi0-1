# Context for postcss.config.mjs

## Purpose
The postcss.config.mjs file is a configuration file for PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. In the JFDI project, it's primarily used to integrate Tailwind CSS.

## Key Components
1. TypeScript type annotation for PostCSS configuration
2. Plugin configuration (Tailwind CSS)

## Configuration Details
- `@type {import('postcss-load-config').Config}`: This comment provides TypeScript type information for the configuration object.
- `plugins`: An object specifying the PostCSS plugins to use:
  - `tailwindcss`: {}`: Configures Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin with default options.

## Implications
- Tailwind CSS is set up to process the project's CSS files.
- The configuration is minimal, relying on default settings for Tailwind CSS.
- No other PostCSS plugins are currently configured, focusing solely on Tailwind CSS integration.

## Interactions with Other Files
- This configuration works in conjunction with the Tailwind CSS configuration file (likely tailwind.config.js or tailwind.config.ts).
- It affects how CSS is processed throughout the Next.js application, including global styles and component-specific styles.
- Interacts with the build process defined in package.json and potentially next.config.mjs.

## Notes
- The use of the .mjs extension indicates that this is a JavaScript module file, allowing for the use of ES6 import/export syntax.
- The configuration is exported as the default export, which is the standard way PostCSS expects to receive the configuration.
- While currently only Tailwind CSS is configured, this file provides an easy way to add more PostCSS plugins in the future if needed.

This postcss.config.mjs file is essential for integrating Tailwind CSS into the JFDI project's CSS processing pipeline. It ensures that Tailwind's utility classes and other features are properly compiled and available throughout the application. If any changes to the CSS processing are needed, such as adding new PostCSS plugins or modifying Tailwind's behavior, this would be one of the key files to update.
