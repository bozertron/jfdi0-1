# Context for components/KnowledgeBase.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the KnowledgeBase component, which provides a simple interface for managing and viewing documents within the JFDI application. It allows users to see a list of files, select a file to view its content, and add new files to the knowledge base.

## Key Components
1. KnowledgeBase: Main functional component
2. Files list: Displays available documents
3. File content viewer: Shows content of selected document
4. File upload input: Allows adding new files to the knowledge base

## Functionality
- Displays a list of files in the knowledge base
- Allows selection of a file to view its content
- Provides an interface to add new files to the knowledge base
- Shows content of the selected file (currently a placeholder)

## Props
The component doesn't accept any props.

## State
- files: An array of strings representing file names in the knowledge base
- selectedFile: A string or null representing the currently selected file

## Main Operations
1. Displaying the list of files
2. Handling file selection
3. Adding new files to the knowledge base

## Interactions with Other Components
This component appears to be self-contained and doesn't directly interact with other components. However, it's likely used within a larger context in the application, possibly within the Dashboard or a dedicated Knowledge Base page.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses React's useState hook for state management
- Implements a simple file upload mechanism using an input of type "file"
- Uses TypeScript for type checking

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements a two-column layout for file list and content display
- Uses hover and selection styles for better user interaction

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Implement actual file content loading and display (currently uses placeholder text)
2. Add file deletion functionality
3. Implement error handling for file uploads
4. Add search functionality for files
5. Implement pagination or virtualization for large numbers of files
6. Add file type icons or previews
7. Implement actual file storage and retrieval, possibly integrating with a backend API

## Notes
- The component currently uses client-side state for managing files, which would not persist across sessions. In a production environment, this would likely be replaced with data fetched from and stored in a backend.
- The file content display is currently a placeholder. In a real application, this would need to be implemented to actually load and display file contents.
- There's no limit on file types that can be uploaded. Depending on the application's requirements, it might be necessary to add file type restrictions.
- The component doesn't handle large numbers of files, which could become an issue as the knowledge base grows.

This KnowledgeBase component provides a basic framework for a document management system within the JFDI application. It offers a simple interface for users to view and add documents, which could be expanded into a more robust knowledge management tool with additional features and backend integration.
