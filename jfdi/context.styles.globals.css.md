# Context for styles/globals.css

## Purpose
This file contains global CSS styles that are applied throughout the JFDI application. It sets up base styles, resets, and global utility classes that are used across different components and pages.

## Type
CSS file

## Potential Contents
1. CSS reset or normalization styles
2. Base styles for HTML elements (body, headings, links, etc.)
3. Global utility classes
4. Custom CSS variables for theming
5. Font declarations and typography styles
6. Layout helpers
7. Responsive design breakpoints
8. Animations or transitions used globally

## Usage
- Imported in the main application file or layout component
- Applies styles that are consistent across all pages and components
- Sets up the foundational styling for the entire application

## Importance
- Ensures a consistent look and feel across the entire application
- Provides a base layer of styles that components can build upon
- Helps in maintaining a cohesive design system

## Related Files
- app/layout.tsx: Likely imports this file for global application of styles
- tailwind.config.js: May interact with Tailwind CSS configurations
- Other component-specific CSS files or styled-components

## Notes
- Care should be taken to avoid overly specific styles that might conflict with component-level styling
- This file should be kept as lean as possible to avoid performance issues
- Consider using CSS variables for values that might change based on themes or user preferences

## Potential Improvements
- Regular audits to remove unused styles
- Consideration of CSS-in-JS solutions for better scoping of styles
- Integration with design tokens for more consistent theming
- Addition of dark mode styles if not already present

## Interaction with Tailwind CSS
- If the project uses Tailwind CSS, this file might include Tailwind's base styles and any custom extensions to Tailwind's utility classes

This globals.css file plays a crucial role in setting up the overall look and feel of the JFDI application, providing a consistent styling foundation that all other components build upon.
