# Context for app/page.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the main page component for the JFDI application using Next.js 13+ app router. It serves as the entry point for the application's user interface.

## Key Components
1. MainLayout component
2. JfdiHubUpdated component
3. Home function component

## Functionality
- Imports and uses the MainLayout component to provide a consistent layout structure.
- Renders the JfdiHubUpdated component, which likely contains the main functionality of the JFDI hub.
- Displays a header with the title "JFDI Hub".

## Interactions with Other Files
- Imports MainLayout from '@/components/layout/MainLayout'.
- Imports JfdiHubUpdated from '@/components/jfdi-hub-updated'.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses functional component syntax with React.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., 'p-6', 'text-3xl', 'font-bold', 'mb-6').

## Implications
- This component will be the main entry point for users accessing the root URL of the application.
- The overall structure and main functionality of the application are encapsulated within the JfdiHubUpdated component.
- The MainLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout across the application.

## Notes
- The component doesn't use any client-side hooks or state, suggesting it could be a server component in Next.js 13+.
- The simplicity of this component suggests that most of the complex logic and state management are handled by the JfdiHubUpdated component.

This page.tsx file serves as the main page of the JFDI application, providing a clean and simple structure that relies on other components for the main functionality. Any changes to the overall layout or main content of the application's home page should be made here or in the referenced components.
