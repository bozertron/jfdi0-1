# Context for ARCHITECTURE.md

## Purpose
The ARCHITECTURE.md file provides a comprehensive overview of the JFDI (Just F***ing Do It) project's structure, components, and functionality. It serves as a high-level guide for developers to understand the project's architecture and key features.

## Key Components
1. Project Structure
2. Key Components and Functionality
3. Technology Stack
4. Configuration
5. Key Features
6. LLM Integration
7. Application Flow
8. Deployment and Security
9. Additional Notes

## Content Overview
- Detailed project structure outlining the organization of directories and files
- Explanation of main components like JfdiHubUpdated, Dashboard, and LLM interfaces
- Description of API routes and their functionalities
- Overview of the technology stack, including Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB
- Configuration details for Next.js, TypeScript, and environment variables
- Explanation of the multi-LLM system and its integration with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model
- Step-by-step application flow from startup to user interaction
- Deployment and security considerations

## Implications
- Provides a single source of truth for the project's architecture
- Aids in onboarding new developers to the project
- Serves as a reference for understanding the relationships between different components
- Highlights the project's key features and technological choices

## Interactions with Other Files
- References various components and their locations within the project structure
- Mentions configuration files like next.config.mjs and tsconfig.json
- Discusses API routes and their corresponding files
- Refers to the database schemas defined in lib/db/

## Notes
- The architecture supports a complex application integrating multiple LLMs, workflow management, and data handling
- The project uses a modular approach with separate components for different functionalities
- Security considerations, such as storing the OpenAI API key, are highlighted
- The document emphasizes the use of Next.js for server-side rendering and API routes

This ARCHITECTURE.md file is crucial for maintaining a clear understanding of the JFDI project's structure and functionality as it evolves. It should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the project's architecture or when new major features are added.
