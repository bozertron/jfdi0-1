# Context for components/layout/Header.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the Header component, which serves as the top navigation bar for the JFDI application. It displays the current page title, provides a button for creating a new campaign, and shows basic user information.

## Key Components
1. Header: Main functional component
2. Page title display
3. "New Campaign" button
4. User information display

## Functionality
- Displays the current page title (hardcoded as "Dashboard" in this version)
- Provides a button to create a new campaign
- Shows basic user information (name and email)

## Props
The component doesn't accept any props.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses the 'use client' directive, indicating it's a client-side component in Next.js
- Implements a functional component with React
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling
- Implements a white background with a shadow for the header
- Uses responsive padding and max-width for different screen sizes
- Applies hover effects to the "New Campaign" button

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Make the page title dynamic based on the current route or passed as a prop
2. Implement functionality for the "New Campaign" button
3. Connect the user information to actual user data, possibly from a context or props
4. Add a logout button or dropdown menu for user actions
5. Implement responsive design for smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices)
6. Add navigation links to other parts of the application
7. Implement internationalization for text content

## Notes
- The user information is currently hardcoded and should be replaced with dynamic data in a real application
- The "New Campaign" button doesn't have any functionality attached to it yet
- The component is designed to be part of a larger layout structure, likely used in combination with other layout components

This Header component serves as the main navigation and information bar for the JFDI application. It provides a consistent top-level interface across different pages of the application, offering quick access to create new campaigns and displaying user information. Its design suggests that campaign creation is a key feature of the application, and that the app has user authentication implemented.
