# Context for Unit Test Master Reference.md

## Purpose
This file serves as a comprehensive guide and reference for unit testing practices within the JFDI project. It likely contains standardized approaches, best practices, and guidelines for writing and maintaining unit tests across the application.

## Type
Markdown documentation file

## Potential Contents
1. Overview of the project's unit testing philosophy
2. Recommended testing frameworks and tools (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)
3. Guidelines for writing effective unit tests
4. Code examples and patterns for common testing scenarios
5. Best practices for test organization and naming conventions
6. Instructions for running tests and interpreting results
7. Coverage requirements and how to measure them
8. Mocking and stubbing strategies
9. Tips for testing asynchronous code
10. Continuous Integration (CI) considerations related to unit tests

## Usage
- Serves as a reference for developers when writing or reviewing unit tests
- Helps maintain consistency in testing approaches across the project
