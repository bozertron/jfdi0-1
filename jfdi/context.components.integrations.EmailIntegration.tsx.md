# Context for components/integrations/EmailIntegration.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the EmailIntegration component, which provides a user interface for connecting to email providers (Google or Microsoft) within the JFDI application. It's designed to simulate the process of integrating email services, although the actual OAuth flow is not implemented.

## Key Components
1. EmailIntegration: Main functional component
2. State management for selected provider and connection status
3. Dropdown for selecting the email provider
4. Connect button for initiating the integration process

## Functionality
- Allows users to select an email provider (Google or Microsoft)
- Simulates the connection process to the selected provider
- Manages the connection state (connected or not connected)

## State
- provider: 'google' | 'microsoft' | '' - Stores the selected email provider
- connected: boolean - Indicates whether the integration is connected

## Main Operations
1. setProvider: Updates the selected email provider
2. connectProvider: Simulates the connection process (currently just logs to console and updates state)

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses React hooks (useState) for state management
- Implements TypeScript for type checking (especially in the provider state)
- Uses template literals and ternary operators for conditional styling

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements a clean, card-like design with rounded corners and shadows
- Uses conditional styling for the connect button based on its state

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Implement actual OAuth flow for real email integration
2. Add error handling for failed connections
3. Provide feedback to the user during the connection process (e.g., loading state)
4. Add the ability to disconnect or switch providers after connection
5. Implement a way to display connected account information
6. Add more email providers

## Notes
- This component is currently a simulation and doesn't perform actual email integration
- The connectProvider function would need to be expanded to initiate a real OAuth flow in a production environment
- There's no persistence of the connection state - it resets when the component is unmounted

This EmailIntegration component serves as a placeholder for email integration functionality in the JFDI application. It provides a user interface for selecting and connecting to email providers, which could be expanded to include real integration with email services, potentially allowing the application to access and manage user emails as part of its workflow or task management features.
