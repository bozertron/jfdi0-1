# Context for app/campaigns/page.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the Campaigns page component for the JFDI application using Next.js 13+ app router. It serves as the entry point for the campaigns section of the application.

## Key Components
1. MainLayout component
2. CampaignManager component
3. CampaignsPage function component

## Functionality
- Imports and uses the MainLayout component to provide a consistent layout structure.
- Renders the CampaignManager component, which likely contains the main functionality for managing campaigns.
- Displays a header with the title "Campaigns".

## Interactions with Other Files
- Imports MainLayout from '@/components/layout/MainLayout'.
- Imports CampaignManager from '@/components/CampaignManager'.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses functional component syntax with React.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., 'p-6', 'text-3xl', 'font-bold', 'mb-6').

## Implications
- This component will be the main entry point for users accessing the /campaigns route of the application.
- The overall structure and main functionality of the campaigns section are encapsulated within the CampaignManager component.
- The MainLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout across the application.

## Notes
- The component doesn't use any client-side hooks or state, suggesting it could be a server component in Next.js 13+.
- The simplicity of this component suggests that most of the complex logic and state management for campaigns are handled by the CampaignManager component.

This page.tsx file serves as the main page for the campaigns section of the JFDI application, providing a clean and simple structure that relies on the CampaignManager component for the main functionality. Any changes to the overall layout or main content of the campaigns page should be made here or in the CampaignManager component.
