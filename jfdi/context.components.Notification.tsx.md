# Context for components/Notification.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the Notification component, which provides a reusable, temporary notification display for the JFDI application. It can be used to show success, error, or informational messages to the user.

## Key Components
1. Notification: Main functional component
2. NotificationProps interface: Defines the props for the component

## Functionality
- Displays a notification message with a specified type (success, error, or info)
- Automatically hides the notification after a specified duration
- Uses different background colors based on the notification type

## Props
The component accepts the following props:
- message: string - The text content of the notification
- type: 'success' | 'error' | 'info' - The type of notification, which determines its background color
- duration?: number - Optional prop to set the display duration in milliseconds (default: 3000ms)

## State
- isVisible: Boolean state to control the visibility of the notification

## Main Operations
1. Rendering the notification message with appropriate styling
2. Setting a timer to hide the notification after the specified duration
3. Determining the background color based on the notification type

## Interactions with Other Components
This component is likely used by various other components throughout the application to display temporary messages to the user. It doesn't directly interact with other components but is probably rendered conditionally by parent components.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses TypeScript for type checking (NotificationProps interface)
- Uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects
- Implements a self-hiding mechanism using setTimeout

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements a fixed positioning at the bottom-right corner of the screen
- Uses different background colors for different notification types (green for success, red for error, blue for info)

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Add an option for the user to manually dismiss the notification
2. Implement stacking or queuing for multiple notifications
3. Add animations for appearing and disappearing
4. Provide more customization options (e.g., custom icons, positions)
5. Implement accessibility features (e.g., aria attributes, keyboard navigation)
6. Add the ability to have actionable notifications (e.g., with buttons or links)

## Notes
- The component is designed to be simple and reusable across the application
- It doesn't persist notifications or handle multiple notifications simultaneously in its current form
- The fixed positioning means it will always appear in the same location, regardless of the page content or scroll position

This Notification component provides a clean and simple way to display temporary messages to users in the JFDI application. Its reusable nature allows for consistent notification styling and behavior across different parts of the application.
