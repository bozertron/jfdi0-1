# Context for components/ui/tooltip.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines a reusable Tooltip component for the JFDI application. It provides a customizable tooltip that can be used throughout the application to display additional information or context when hovering over elements.

## Key Components
1. TooltipProvider: Context provider for tooltips
2. Tooltip: Root component for tooltip functionality
3. TooltipTrigger: Component that triggers the tooltip display
4. TooltipContent: Component that renders the actual tooltip content

## Functionality
- Creates a customizable tooltip system using Radix UI's Tooltip primitive
- Allows for consistent styling and behavior of tooltips across the application
- Provides animated entrance and exit for tooltips

## Props
TooltipContent extends Radix UI's TooltipContent props and adds:
- className: Allows for additional CSS classes to be applied
- sideOffset: Determines the offset from the trigger element (default: 4)

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses "use client" directive, indicating it's a client-side component in Next.js
- Imports Radix UI's Tooltip primitive for core functionality
- Uses React.forwardRef for proper ref forwarding on TooltipContent
- Utilizes the cn utility function for class name merging

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Implements a consistent look with rounded corners, background color, and text color
- Applies animations for entrance and exit effects
- Uses z-index to ensure tooltips appear above other content

## Component Details
- TooltipContent has a default side offset of 4 units
- Tooltip background uses the 'primary' color from the theme
- Text is extra small (text-xs) and uses the 'primary-foreground' color
- Implements various animations for different entrance/exit directions

## Animations
- Fade in/out
- Zoom in/out
- Slide in/out from different directions based on tooltip position

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Add variants for different tooltip styles (e.g., light, dark, info, warning)
2. Implement custom positioning options
3. Add support for arrow pointers
4. Include options for controlling animation duration or disabling animations
5. Add accessibility enhancements (e.g., aria attributes)

## Notes
- The component is built on top of Radix UI's Tooltip primitive, ensuring good accessibility and customization options
- The use of Tailwind CSS classes allows for easy theming and consistency with the overall design system
- The component doesn't include any built-in delay for showing/hiding tooltips, which might be desirable in some cases
- The animations are comprehensive, providing a polished user experience

This Tooltip component serves as a flexible and reusable UI element in the JFDI application. Its design allows for consistent tooltip behavior and styling across the application, while still providing customization options. The use of Radix UI primitives suggests a focus on accessibility and robust functionality.
