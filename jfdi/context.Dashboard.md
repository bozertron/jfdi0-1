# Context for Dashboard.tsx

## Purpose
The Dashboard component serves as the main user interface for managing workflows and accessing various LLM (Language Learning Model) interfaces within the JFDI application. It provides a centralized location for users to view, create, and manage both personal and shared workflows, as well as interact with different AI models.

## Functionality
1. Displays a welcome message with the user's name.
2. Manages tabs for different sections: Workflows, LLMs (Vee, Maestro, Create), and Data Compiler.
3. Fetches and displays personal and shared workflows.
4. Provides a form for creating new workflows.
5. Renders LLM interfaces and the Data Compiler based on the active tab.

## Key Components
1. Tab navigation for different sections.
2. Workflow creation form.
3. Lists of personal and shared workflows.
4. Integration with LLMInterface component for different AI models.
5. Integration with DataCompiler component.

## Interactions with Other Files
1. `../contexts/AppContext`: Uses the `useApp` hook to access user information.
2. `./LLMInterface`: Renders the LLM interface for different AI models.
3. `./DataCompiler`: Renders the Data Compiler interface.

## API Interactions
1. Fetches personal workflows: GET `/api/workflows?userId=${user}`
2. Fetches shared workflows: GET `/api/workflows?shared=true`
3. Creates new workflows: POST `/api/workflows?userId=${user}&shared=${isSharedWorkflow}`

## State Management
1. Uses React's `useState` for local state management:
   - `personalWorkflows` and `sharedWorkflows`: Arrays of workflow objects
   - `newWorkflowName`, `newWorkflowDescription`, `newWorkflowSteps`: Form inputs for creating new workflows
   - `isSharedWorkflow`: Boolean to determine if a new workflow is shared
   - `activeTab`: String to track the currently active tab

2. Uses `useEffect` to fetch workflows when the user state changes.

## Key Functions
1. `fetchWorkflows`: Asynchronous function to fetch both personal and shared workflows from the API.
2. `handleCreateWorkflow`: Asynchronous function to handle the creation of a new workflow via the API.

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Implements a light theme with gray and blue color accents.

## TypeScript Interfaces
- Defines a `Workflow` interface to type-check workflow objects.

## Notes
- The component is responsive to user authentication state, fetching workflows only when a user is logged in.
- It provides a tabbed interface to switch between workflow management, different LLM interfaces, and the Data Compiler.
- The workflow creation form allows users to specify whether a new workflow is shared or personal.
- Error handling is implemented for API calls, with errors logged to the console.

This Dashboard component is crucial to the JFDI application, as it serves as the main interface for users to interact with workflows and access various AI-driven features. It integrates closely with the backend API for data management and other components for specialized functionalities like LLM interactions and data compilation.
