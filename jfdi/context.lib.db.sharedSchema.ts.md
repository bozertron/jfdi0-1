# Context for lib/db/sharedSchema.ts

## Purpose
This file defines Mongoose schemas and models for shared data structures used across the JFDI application. It includes schemas for company-wide information and shared workflows.

## Key Components
1. ICompanyData interface: Defines the structure for company-wide data
2. CompanyDataSchema: Mongoose schema for company data
3. ISharedWorkflow interface: Defines the structure for shared workflows
4. SharedWorkflowSchema: Mongoose schema for shared workflows
5. Exported Mongoose models: CompanyData and SharedWorkflow

## Functionality
- Defines the structure and validation rules for company-wide data
- Defines the structure and validation rules for shared workflows
- Provides Mongoose models for interacting with these data structures in the database

## Exports
- CompanyData: Mongoose model for company-wide data
- SharedWorkflow: Mongoose model for shared workflows

## Interfaces
1. ICompanyData:
   - name: string (required, unique)
   - value: any (required)
   - createdAt: Date
   - updatedAt: Date

2. ISharedWorkflow:
   - name: string (required)
   - description: string (optional)
   - steps: string[] (array of strings)
   - createdBy: string (required)
   - createdAt: Date
   - updatedAt: Date

## Schema Details
1. CompanyDataSchema:
   - Enforces unique names for company data entries
   - Uses Schema.Types.Mixed for flexible value types
   - Automatically sets createdAt and updatedAt timestamps

2. SharedWorkflowSchema:
   - Allows for optional description
   - Stores workflow steps as an array of strings
   - Tracks the creator of the shared workflow
   - Automatically sets createdAt and updatedAt timestamps

## Usage
These models can be imported and used in API routes or server-side functions to interact with the MongoDB database. For example:

```typescript
import { CompanyData, SharedWorkflow } from '@/lib/db/sharedSchema';

// Creating a new company data entry
const newData = new CompanyData({ name: 'Company Policy', value: 'Our policy content...' });
await newData.save();

// Creating a new shared workflow
const newWorkflow = new SharedWorkflow({
  name: 'Customer Onboarding',
  steps: ['Step 1', 'Step 2', 'Step 3'],
  createdBy: 'user123'
});
await newWorkflow.save();
```

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses TypeScript interfaces to define document structures
- Leverages Mongoose's Schema and model functions for MongoDB integration
- Implements automatic timestamp management for createdAt and updatedAt fields

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Add more detailed validation rules (e.g., min/max lengths for strings)
2. Implement custom validation methods if needed
3. Consider adding indexes for frequently queried fields
4. Add methods to the schemas for common operations

## Notes
- The CompanyData schema allows for flexible value types, which might require careful handling in the application code
- The SharedWorkflow schema doesn't currently have a mechanism to manage access control (who can view/edit shared workflows)
- Both schemas use the default MongoDB document _id for unique identification

This sharedSchema.ts file is crucial for maintaining consistent data structures for shared information across the JFDI application. It provides the foundation for storing and managing company-wide data and shared workflows, which are likely central to the application's functionality.
