# Context for app/knowledge/page.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the Knowledge Base page component for the JFDI application using Next.js 13+ app router. It serves as the entry point for the knowledge base section of the application, providing access to stored information and resources.

## Key Components
1. MainLayout component
2. KnowledgeBase component
3. KnowledgePage function component

## Functionality
- Imports and uses the MainLayout component to provide a consistent layout structure.
- Renders the KnowledgeBase component, which likely contains the main functionality for accessing and managing the knowledge base.
- Displays a header with the title "Knowledge Base".

## Interactions with Other Files
- Imports MainLayout from '@/components/layout/MainLayout'.
- Imports KnowledgeBase from '@/components/KnowledgeBase'.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses functional component syntax with React.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., 'p-6', 'text-3xl', 'font-bold', 'mb-6').

## Implications
- This component will be the main entry point for users accessing the /knowledge route of the application.
- The overall structure and main functionality of the knowledge base section are encapsulated within the KnowledgeBase component.
- The MainLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout across the application.

## Notes
- The component doesn't use any client-side hooks or state, suggesting it could be a server component in Next.js 13+.
- The simplicity of this component suggests that most of the complex logic and state management for the knowledge base are handled by the KnowledgeBase component.

This page.tsx file serves as the main page for the knowledge base section of the JFDI application, providing a clean and simple structure that relies on the KnowledgeBase component for the main functionality. Any changes to the overall layout or main content of the knowledge base page should be made here or in the KnowledgeBase component. The knowledge base likely plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving information that supports other parts of the JFDI application, such as workflows, campaigns, or LLM interactions.
