# Context for app/workflows/page.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the Workflows page component for the JFDI application using Next.js 13+ app router. It serves as the entry point for the workflows section of the application, where users can create and manage workflows.

## Key Components
1. MainLayout component
2. WorkflowCreator component
3. WorkflowsPage function component

## Functionality
- Imports and uses the MainLayout component to provide a consistent layout structure.
- Renders the WorkflowCreator component, which likely contains the main functionality for creating and managing workflows.
- Displays a header with the title "Workflows".

## Interactions with Other Files
- Imports MainLayout from '@/components/layout/MainLayout'.
- Imports WorkflowCreator from '@/components/WorkflowCreator'.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses functional component syntax with React.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., 'p-6', 'text-3xl', 'font-bold', 'mb-6').

## Implications
- This component will be the main entry point for users accessing the /workflows route of the application.
- The overall structure and main functionality of the workflows section are encapsulated within the WorkflowCreator component.
- The MainLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout across the application.

## Notes
- The component doesn't use any client-side hooks or state, suggesting it could be a server component in Next.js 13+.
- The simplicity of this component suggests that most of the complex logic and state management for workflows are handled by the WorkflowCreator component.

This page.tsx file serves as the main page for the workflows section of the JFDI application, providing a clean and simple structure that relies on the WorkflowCreator component for the main functionality. Any changes to the overall layout or main content of the workflows page should be made here or in the WorkflowCreator component. The workflows functionality is likely a core feature of the JFDI application, allowing users to create, manage, and possibly automate sequences of tasks or processes.
