# Context for components/CampaignManager.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the CampaignManager component, which is responsible for displaying and managing campaigns within the JFDI application. It provides a user interface for viewing existing campaigns and adding new ones.

## Key Components
1. Campaign interface: Defines the structure of a campaign object
2. CampaignManager functional component
3. useState hook for managing campaign state
4. addCampaign function for creating new campaigns
5. JSX for rendering the campaign management interface

## Functionality
- Displays a list of campaigns in a table format
- Allows adding new campaigns with a default configuration
- Uses React's useState hook to manage the state of campaigns

## Props
The component doesn't accept any props.

## State
- campaigns: An array of Campaign objects, initialized with three sample campaigns

## Main Operations
1. Rendering a table of existing campaigns
2. Adding new campaigns via the "Add Campaign" button

## Interactions with Other Components
This component is likely used within the campaigns page or dashboard of the application. It doesn't directly interact with other components but may be part of a larger campaign management system.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses TypeScript for type checking (Campaign interface)
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements a functional component with React hooks

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for layout and design
- Applies a white background with rounded corners and shadow for the main container
- Uses a blue button for adding campaigns
- Implements a simple table design with alternating background colors for header and rows

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Implement CRUD operations for campaigns (currently only supports adding)
2. Add form validation for new campaigns
3. Integrate with a backend API to persist campaign data
4. Implement sorting and filtering capabilities for the campaign list
5. Add pagination for large numbers of campaigns
6. Implement error handling and loading states

## Notes
- The component currently uses hard-coded sample data. In a production environment, this would likely be replaced with data fetched from an API.
- The "Add Campaign" functionality creates campaigns with default values. This could be expanded to include a form for inputting campaign details.
- There's no functionality to edit or delete existing campaigns, which might be necessary for a full-featured campaign manager.

This CampaignManager component serves as a basic framework for managing campaigns in the JFDI application. It provides a simple interface for viewing and adding campaigns, which can be expanded upon to create a more robust campaign management system.
