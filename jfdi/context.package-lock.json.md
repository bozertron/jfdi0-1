# Context for package-lock.json

## Purpose
The package-lock.json file is an automatically generated file that locks the versions of installed npm packages and their dependencies. It ensures that all developers working on the project and deployment environments use the exact same versions of dependencies.

## Type
JSON configuration file

## Usage
- Provides a detailed description of the project's dependency tree
- Ensures consistent installations across different environments
- Used by npm to recreate the node_modules directory exactly as it was when the project was developed

## Key Features
- Lists all packages and their dependencies with exact versions
- Includes integrity hashes for each package to verify the correct package is being installed
- Records the resolved URL for each package, which is used for fetching the package

## Importance
- Critical for maintaining consistent builds and preventing "works on my machine" issues
- Helps in tracking changes to dependencies over time
- Improves security by locking dependencies to known, safe versions

## Interaction with Other Files
- Closely related to package.json, but provides more detailed and specific information
- Used in conjunction with the node_modules directory, which contains the actual installed packages

## Notes
- Should be committed to version control
- Automatically updated when running npm commands that modify the node_modules tree
- Should not be manually edited; instead, use npm commands to manage dependencies

## Potential Considerations
- Ensure all team members are using compatible npm versions to avoid inconsistencies
- Regularly update dependencies and review the changes in package-lock.json
- Be aware of the implications of using `npm ci` vs `npm install` in different scenarios (e.g., development vs. CI/CD pipelines)

This file plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and reproducibility in the JFDI project's development and deployment processes.
