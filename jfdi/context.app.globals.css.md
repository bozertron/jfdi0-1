# Context for app/globals.css

## Purpose
This file contains global CSS styles and configurations for the JFDI application. It sets up Tailwind CSS, defines custom properties for theming, and establishes base styles for the entire application.

## Key Components
1. Tailwind CSS directives
2. Root-level custom properties for light and dark themes
3. Base styles for the body
4. Custom utility classes
5. Detailed theme configuration using CSS custom properties

## Functionality
- Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities.
- Defines basic light and dark theme colors using media queries.
- Sets up a comprehensive theme using CSS custom properties for various UI elements.
- Applies base styles to the body and all elements.
- Adds a custom utility class for text balancing.

## Notable CSS Elements
- Uses `@tailwind` directives to include Tailwind CSS styles.
- Defines two sets of theme variables: one basic set and one more comprehensive set.
- Implements a dark mode theme using a `.dark` class.
- Uses `@layer` directives to organize styles into Tailwind's layer system.
- Applies Tailwind classes using `@apply` within `@layer base`.

## Theme Configuration
- Defines colors for background, foreground, card, popover, primary, secondary, muted, accent, and destructive states.
- Includes specific colors for chart elements (chart-1 through chart-5).
- Sets up a custom border radius variable (`--radius`).
- Provides distinct color schemes for light and dark modes.

## Implications
- The application supports both light and dark themes.
- The use of CSS custom properties allows for easy theme customization and dynamic theme switching.
- The comprehensive theme setup suggests a consistent design system across the application.
- The inclusion of chart colors indicates that the application likely includes data visualization components.

## Notes
- The file uses modern CSS features like custom properties and `@layer` directives.
- The theme is highly customizable and can be easily modified by changing the CSS custom properties.
- The use of Tailwind CSS suggests that most styling in the application will be done using utility classes.
- The `text-balance` utility class adds support for the CSS `text-wrap: balance` property, which is a modern text layout feature.

This globals.css file is crucial for maintaining a consistent look and feel across the JFDI application. It provides a foundation for theming and global styles that will be used throughout the project. Any global style changes or theme modifications should be made in this file.
