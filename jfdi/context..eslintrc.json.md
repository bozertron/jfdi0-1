# Context for .eslintrc.json

## Purpose
This file configures ESLint for the JFDI project, setting up the linting rules and environment for the codebase.

## Key Components
1. `extends`: An array of ESLint configurations to extend from.

## Configuration Details
- The project extends two ESLint configurations:
  1. `"next/core-web-vitals"`: This includes the core ESLint rules recommended for Next.js projects, with a focus on Web Vitals.
  2. `"next/typescript"`: This adds TypeScript-specific linting rules for Next.js projects.

## Implications
- By using these configurations, the project ensures:
  1. Adherence to Next.js best practices.
  2. Optimization for Web Vitals metrics.
  3. TypeScript-aware linting for improved type safety and code quality.

## Interactions with Other Files
- This configuration applies to all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project.
- It works in conjunction with the `tsconfig.json` file for TypeScript-specific settings.

## Notes
- The configuration is minimal, relying on the default rules provided by Next.js.
- Developers can add custom rules or override existing ones by adding a `rules` section to this file if needed.
- This setup provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and consistency across the JFDI project.
