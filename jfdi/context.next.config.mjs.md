# Context for next.config.mjs

## Purpose
The next.config.mjs file is a configuration file for Next.js in the JFDI project. It defines various settings that control how the Next.js application behaves during development and production.

## Key Components
1. TypeScript type annotation for NextConfig
2. reactStrictMode setting
3. Server configuration (host and port)

## Configuration Details
- `@type {import('next').NextConfig}`: This comment provides TypeScript type information for the configuration object.
- `reactStrictMode: true`: Enables React's Strict Mode, which helps identify potential problems in the application.
- `server`: Configures the development server settings:
  - `host: '0.0.0.0'`: Sets the server to listen on all available network interfaces.
  - `port: 3000`: Sets the default port for the development server.

## Implications
- React Strict Mode is enabled, which may cause components to render twice in development mode for debugging purposes.
- The server is configured to be accessible from any network interface (0.0.0.0), which allows for easy testing on different devices on the same network.
- The default port is set to 3000, but the comment suggests this can be changed if needed.

## Interactions with Other Files
- This configuration affects how the entire Next.js application runs, including all pages and API routes.
- It may interact with environment variables if any are used in the configuration (though none are used in this current version).

## Notes
- The use of the .mjs extension indicates that this is a JavaScript module file, allowing for the use of ES6 import/export syntax.
- The configuration is exported as the default export, which is the standard way Next.js expects to receive the configuration.
- The server configuration is particularly useful for development and testing across different devices or in containerized environments.

This next.config.mjs file provides essential configuration for the Next.js application in the JFDI project. It ensures that the application runs in strict mode and is accessible across the network during development. Any changes to this file can significantly impact how the application behaves and is served, so modifications should be made carefully and with consideration for both development and production environments.
