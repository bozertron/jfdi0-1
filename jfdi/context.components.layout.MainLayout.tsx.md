# Context for components/layout/MainLayout.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the MainLayout component, which serves as the primary layout structure for the JFDI application. It combines the Sidebar and Header components and provides a container for the main content of the application.

## Key Components
1. MainLayout: Main functional component
2. Sidebar component (imported)
3. Header component (imported)
4. Main content area

## Functionality
- Provides a consistent layout structure for the application
- Incorporates the Sidebar for navigation
- Includes the Header for top-level information and actions
- Renders child components in the main content area

## Props
- children: React.ReactNode - The content to be rendered in the main area of the layout

## Interactions with Other Components
- Imports and uses the Sidebar component
- Imports and uses the Header component
- Renders any child components passed to it in the main content area

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses the 'use client' directive, indicating it's a client-side component in Next.js
- Implements a functional component with TypeScript for type checking
- Uses React.FC type with a custom interface (MainLayoutProps) for component props

## Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
- Implements a full-height screen layout with a sidebar and main content area
- Uses flexbox for layout structure
- Applies background colors to different sections (bg-gray-100 for the overall layout, bg-gray-200 for the main content area)
- Handles overflow with scrolling in the main content area

## Potential Areas for Improvement
1. Add responsive design for smaller screens (e.g., collapsible sidebar for mobile devices)
2. Implement context or state management to control sidebar visibility
3. Add loading states or transitions between route changes
4. Implement error boundaries to catch and display errors in child components
5. Add accessibility features (e.g., skip to main content link)

## Notes
- This component assumes that Sidebar and Header components are always visible
- The main content area is set to scroll vertically if content exceeds the viewport height
- The layout is designed to take up the full height of the screen (h-screen)

This MainLayout component serves as the fundamental structure for the JFDI application's user interface. It provides a consistent layout across different pages or views, incorporating navigation through the Sidebar, top-level actions via the Header, and a flexible main content area. This structure allows for a cohesive user experience while navigating different parts of the application.
