# Context for api/companydata/route.ts

## Purpose
This API route manages company-wide data in the JFDI application. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting company data, allowing for shared information storage and retrieval across the entire organization.

## Functionality
1. GET: Retrieves all company data.
2. POST: Creates a new company data entry.
3. PUT: Updates an existing company data entry.
4. DELETE: Removes a company data entry from the system.
5. OPTIONS: Provides information about allowed HTTP methods.

## Key Components
1. GET handler for fetching all company data.
2. POST handler for creating new company data entries.
3. PUT handler for updating existing company data entries.
4. DELETE handler for removing company data entries.
5. OPTIONS handler for responding to preflight requests.

## Interactions with Other Files
1. `@/lib/db/connection`: Imports the `dbConnect` function to establish a database connection.
2. `@/lib/db/sharedSchema`: Imports the `CompanyData` model for database operations.

## Database Interactions
1. Reads from the database to fetch all company data.
2. Writes to the database to create new company data entries.
3. Updates existing company data entries in the database.
4. Deletes company data entries from the database.

## Request Handling
1. GET:
   - Retrieves all company data entries without any filters.
2. POST:
   - Validates incoming data (name and value are required).
   - Creates a new company data entry in the database.
3. PUT:
   - Parses `id` from query parameters.
   - Updates the specified company data entry with the provided data.
4. DELETE:
   - Parses `id` from query parameters.
   - Removes the specified company data entry from the database.

## Error Handling
- Returns appropriate error responses (400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
- Logs errors to the console for debugging purposes.

## Security Considerations
- Unlike user-specific routes, this route doesn't require a userId, as it deals with company-wide data.
- Does not implement authentication or authorization (this should be handled by a middleware).
- Care should be taken to ensure only authorized personnel can access and modify company data.

## Response Format
- Returns JSON responses for both successful operations and errors.
- Uses appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for successful GET/PUT/DELETE, 201 for successful POST, 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).

## Notes
- The route uses Next.js 13+ API Routes with the `app` directory structure.
- It leverages the `NextResponse` object for structuring responses.
- The OPTIONS method is implemented to support CORS preflight requests.
- The implementation allows for storing and retrieving company-wide information that can be accessed across different parts of the application.

This API route is crucial for managing shared, company-wide data in the JFDI application. It enables the storage and retrieval of information that is relevant to all users or the organization as a whole. This could include company policies, global settings, shared resources, or any other data that needs to be consistent across the entire application. The CompanyData model's flexibility (with 'name' and 'value' fields) allows for storing various types of company-related information, making it versatile for different organizational needs within the application.
