# Context for app/integrations/page.tsx

## Purpose
This file defines the Integrations page component for the JFDI application using Next.js 13+ app router. It serves as the entry point for the integrations section of the application, showcasing various integration options.

## Key Components
1. MainLayout component
2. EmailIntegration component
3. TextIntegration component
4. IntegrationsPage function component

## Functionality
- Imports and uses the MainLayout component to provide a consistent layout structure.
- Renders the EmailIntegration and TextIntegration components, which likely contain the functionality for setting up email and text message integrations.
- Displays a header with the title "Integrations".

## Interactions with Other Files
- Imports MainLayout from '@/components/layout/MainLayout'.
- Imports EmailIntegration from '@/components/integrations/EmailIntegration'.
- Imports TextIntegration from '@/components/integrations/TextIntegration'.

## Notable Code Elements
- Uses functional component syntax with React.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS classes for styling (e.g., 'p-6', 'text-3xl', 'font-bold', 'mb-6').

## Implications
- This component will be the main entry point for users accessing the /integrations route of the application.
- The page presents two types of integrations: email and text messaging.
- The MainLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout across the application.

## Notes
- The component doesn't use any client-side hooks or state, suggesting it could be a server component in Next.js 13+.
- The simplicity of this component suggests that most of the complex logic and state management for integrations are handled by the EmailIntegration and TextIntegration components.
- The structure allows for easy addition of more integration types in the future by simply importing and adding new integration components.

This page.tsx file serves as the main page for the integrations section of the JFDI application, providing a clean and simple structure that showcases different integration options. Any changes to the overall layout or addition of new integration types should be made here, while the specific functionality for each integration type is managed in their respective components.
