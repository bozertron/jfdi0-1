# Context for api/workflows/route.ts

## Purpose
This API route handles the creation and retrieval of workflows in the JFDI application. It supports both personal and shared workflows, providing endpoints for fetching existing workflows and creating new ones.

## Functionality
1. GET: Retrieves workflows based on query parameters.
   - Fetches shared workflows or personal workflows for a specific user.
2. POST: Creates a new workflow.
   - Supports creating both shared and personal workflows.
3. OPTIONS: Provides information about allowed HTTP methods.

## Key Components
1. GET handler for fetching workflows.
2. POST handler for creating new workflows.
3. OPTIONS handler for responding to preflight requests.

## Interactions with Other Files
1. `@/lib/db/connection`: Imports the `dbConnect` function to establish a database connection.
2. `@/lib/db/sharedSchema`: Imports the `SharedWorkflow` model for shared workflows.
3. `@/lib/db/userSchema`: Imports the `PersonalWorkflow` model for personal workflows.

## Database Interactions
1. Reads from the database to fetch workflows.
2. Writes to the database to create new workflows.

## Request Handling
1. GET:
   - Parses `userId` and `shared` from query parameters.
   - Returns shared workflows or personal workflows for a specific user.
2. POST:
   - Parses `userId` and `shared` from query parameters.
   - Validates incoming data (name and steps are required).
   - Creates a new workflow in the appropriate collection (shared or personal).

## Error Handling
- Returns appropriate error responses (400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).
- Logs errors to the console for debugging purposes.

## Security Considerations
- Requires `userId` for personal workflow operations to ensure data isolation.
- Does not implement authentication or authorization (this should be handled by a middleware).

## Response Format
- Returns JSON responses for both successful operations and errors.
- Uses appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for successful GET, 201 for successful POST, 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors).

## Notes
- The route uses Next.js 13+ API Routes with the `app` directory structure.
- It leverages the `NextResponse` object for structuring responses.
- The OPTIONS method is implemented to support CORS preflight requests.
- The route doesn't handle updating or deleting workflows (these operations would need to be added if required).

This API route is crucial for the workflow management functionality of the JFDI application. It's used by the frontend components (like the Dashboard) to fetch and create workflows, forming a key part of the application's data management system. The separation of shared and personal workflows allows for flexible use cases within the application.
